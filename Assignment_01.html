<h3>My Trip To  California</h3>
<br />
<p>
It was an early June morning and I was packing for a trip that we were leaving for in five hours. I was very excited because I was going to California for the first time. The reason I was going to California was because I really wanted to go there, and my sister wanted me to visit her. My momâ€™s birthday was also during this week, and she wanted to see my sister so we decided to go visit her.

<h3>My Trip To The Rockies</h3>
<br />
<p>
Every year the day after school ends in May, my dad, my brothers, and I go camping in Colorado in the Rocky Mountains.  We usually  go for a week (7days), and work 2 or 3 days.  Our work usually consists of clearing undergrowth and brush, digging up junipers, picking up aspen and fir tree deadfall, along with many many other things.

<h3>My Trip To The Mid West</h3>
<br />
<p>
Devotees of Iowa history will be both delighted and, on occasion, frustrated by the fine anthology. The American Midwest: Essays on Regional
History. Frustrated because, while the book charts the protean boundaries of the Midwest in both a geographical and sociohistorical sense, it
pledges itself primarily to the territories of the Old Northwest: Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
